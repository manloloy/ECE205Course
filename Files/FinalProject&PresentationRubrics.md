# Final Project Rubrics Module

## Overview

This module presents **two separate rubrics** for the final assessment of your work:

1. **Final Project Rubric** (150 points - Weighted at 40% of your Final Grade)  
2. **Final Project Presentation Rubric** (100 points - Weighted at 20% of your Final Grade)

Both rubrics are required for course completion. Please read each carefully to ensure you fulfill all requirements.

## Final Project Rubric (100 points)

The final project is a cumulative demonstration of the skills and concepts you have learned throughout the course. Your final submission must include the source code, a short written report, and written peer feedback for other students' presentations.

###  Requirements

| Category | Description | Points |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Functionality** | Code compiles, runs successfully, and demonstrates a complete and coherent application or game | **15 pts** |
| **Use of Classes** | Project shows effective use of object-oriented programming (OOP) with well-defined and logically separated classes | **15 pts** |
| **Inheritance or Composition** | Project shows meaningful use of either inheritance or composition for structuring related behavior | **10 pts** |
| **Design Patterns** | At least two different design patterns are implemented clearly and effectively (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.) | **15 pts** |
| **Report: Introduction** | Describes the theme, purpose, or gameplay of the project clearly | **5 pts** |
| **Report: Workflow or Gameplay** | Describes how the app functions or how gameplay flows from start to end | **5 pts** |
| **Report: Classes and Relationships** | Clearly explains the classes created and how they work together | **10 pts** |
| **Report: Inheritance/Composition** | Discusses the specific inheritance or composition techniques used | **10 pts** |
| **Report: Design Patterns** | Explains which design patterns were used, how, and why | **15 pts** |
| **Report: Sample Code** | Each report section includes clear, commented code snippets from the project to illustrate main points | **10 pts** |
| **Report: Lessons Learned** | Reflects on challenges and insights gained during the project | **15 pts** |
| **Report: What Would Be Done Differently** | Thoughtful discussion on possible improvements or alternative approaches | **15 pts** |
| **Peer Feedback** | Submitted feedback (0.5–1 page) for at least 2 classmates’ presentations. Constructive, specific, and thoughtful | **10 pts** |

## Final Project Presentation Rubric (100 points)

Your in-class presentation is your opportunity to showcase your work and understanding. It should mirror the structure of your report while also allowing you to discuss and demonstrate your app live.

###  Requirements

| Category | Description | Points |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Introduction** | Clearly explains the gameplay, purpose, or application idea | **10 pts** |
| **Design Considerations** | Describes the key ideas or challenges in structuring the project | **10 pts** |
| **Classes** | Explains what classes were created and how they interact | **10 pts** |
| **Inheritance or Composition** | Explains how either inheritance or composition was used | **10 pts** |
| **Design Patterns** | Discusses which design patterns were implemented and their role | **15 pts** |
| **Code Understanding** | Demonstrates a clear understanding of your code during the walkthrough | **15 pts** |
| **Communication** | Presenter speaks clearly, confidently, and stays on topic | **10 pts** |
| **Visual Demonstration** | Project is run live or with a clear video/screenshots; well-prepared | **10 pts** |
| **Q&A** | Presenter answers questions effectively and shows understanding | **10 pts** |

> **Tip:** A live demo is definitely better but have a video recording of your app being used just in case things don't work out.
