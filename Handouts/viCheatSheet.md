# `vi` Cheat Sheet for Beginners

Provides a beginner-friendly reference for using the `vi` text editor, a powerful and widely available editor in Unix/Linux environments. This cheat sheet focuses on navigation, editing, saving, and quitting â€” the core skills needed to start using `vi` effectively.

To **return to normal mode**, press `Esc`.
