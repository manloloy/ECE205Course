## Course Description  
ECE 205 is a foundational course in C and C++ programming designed for students with prior programming experience (typically Python). This course explores system-level programming, memory management, data structures, and modern object-oriented techniques in C++. The lab component supports practical application through weekly assignments and projects.

## Course Topics

### Linux, Bash, and Environment Setup
- Terminal usage, file system navigation
- File permissions and management
- Introduction to the `vi` editor
- Compiling and running C/C++ from the terminal

### C Programming
- Standard I/O (`scanf`, `printf`)
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions and scope
- Arrays and strings
- Pointers and pointer arithmetic
- Structs and memory layout
- Makefiles and build automation
- Command-line arguments

### C++ Programming
- Input/output (`cin`, `cout`)
- Namespaces and the `std` namespace
- Classes, encapsulation, and member functions
- Constructors, destructors
- Operator overloading
- Inheritance, Compostiion
- Function overloading
- RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
- Introduction to STL: vectors, strings

### Design Patterns (C++-focused)
- Object Pool
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Strategy Pattern
- RAII as a design pattern

### Object-Oriented Design Foundations
- Problem solving with reusable abstractions
- Scriptable object concept and simulation using C++

### Data Structures (C++)
- Linked lists (singly and doubly)
- Binary trees and binary search trees
- Recursion vs iteration
- Memoization

### Practical Concepts
- Debugging tools (`gdb`)
- Best practices in system-level programming
- Use of Git and Github

## Labs
Weekly 3-hour sessions. Students are expected to complete assigned tasks during or after the session and submit them within one week. Labs emphasize:
- Practical C and C++ programming
- Applying lecture concepts
- Unix workflow and compilation
- Progressive development toward projects

## Grading Breakdown

## Academic Honesty
Students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic integrity. Any violations may result in disciplinary action per University guidelines.

## Notes
- Students should expect to code both in lab and at home.
- Weekly labs are crucial to mastering material.
- Bring questions to office hours, labs, or lectures early and often.
